## 🔬 Methodology & Definitions

- **Ghost Bus**: A transit run that is published in GTFS schedules or trip updates but never arrives because no physical vehicle is assigned or broadcasting GPS positions, or because it was dropped without timely passenger notification.
- **On-Time Adherence**: Departures between 1 minute before scheduled time and up to 5 minutes after scheduled time.
- **Early Departure**: Vehicles departing more than 60 seconds early. In transit operations, early departures are treated as major service failures because passengers arrive on time only to find the vehicle already gone.
- **Excess Wait Time (EWT)**: Transit standard metric measuring variance in vehicle headway caused by vehicle bunching.
- **Git-Scraping**: Every run fetches upstream GTFS-RT binary protobuf feeds, computes reliability metrics, commits versioned JSON snapshots, and renders this dashboard automatically.
